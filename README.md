# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project is my first portfolio, it contains a short paragraph about myself, some recent projects that I have worked on, as well as some ways to connect with me.
I built this portfolio as a way to display my talents and showcase my favorite works.  During this experience I learned a lot about design as well as some new uses for flexbox.
